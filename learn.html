      <h2 id="definition">DEFINITION</h2>
        <p>Alzheimer’s the most common form of dementia which is just an umbrella term used to describe loss of memory, language, problem solving, and other thinking abilities. More specifically, Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that is categorized by a loss of memory, along with basic life skills like eating, bathing, talking, etc. It’s a condition that permanently affects the brain and is more common for people older than 60 and is the 5th leading cause of death among adults aged 65 years or older.</p>
      <h2 id="symptoms">SYMPTOMS</h2>
        <p>Common symptoms include memory loss, paranoia, depression, anger, aggression, anxiety, apathy, loneliness, and psychosis.  However. these symptoms vary from person to person. The affected person forgets the names and faces of closed ones and previously familiar places are no longer known to them. They gradually start to lose their thinking skills, and later the capacity to carry out simple tasks like tying shoelaces or even walking. They commonly experience hallucinations, seeing and hearing things that are not there, and encounter difficulty sleeping. </p>
      <h2 id="progress">PROGRESS</h2>
        <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive disease. This means that it develops and gets worse over time. In the first stages of Alzheimer’s disease, there is usually very mild memory loss or problems with thinking abilities. The person may have a hard time remembering where they placed something or have a hard time recalling the right word to say. However, they still are independent, meaning they can still take care of themselves and do things like driving.
        <br>During the middle stages of Alzheimer’s disease, the cognitive processes get worse. Now the person may not be able to remember their personal history, like their address or phone number. They also may have a hard time recalling memories or remembering something from their past. The person is no longer able to take care of themselves because in this stage, they tend to forget where they are and often have a hard time using the bathroom or getting dressed appropriately for the day. An example of this is the person wearing shorts in the winter. Along with the cognitive changes, the person may begin to feel sad, lonely, anxious, and paranoid. The symptoms vary from person to person.
        When the person hits stage 2, they will need a caregiver to assist them with their tasks and the caregiving will increase as the disease progresses.
        <br>The final stage of Alzheimer’s disease is when people begin to lose sense and control of the environment around them. By this point, the cognitive abilities of the individual have tremendously decreased. They can no longer speak in long formulated sentences, instead they speak in short fragments or words. They have trouble completing everyday tasks like walking, sitting, eating, and drinking. This means that they require around the clock assistance to make sure that they are remembering to eat and to help them eat. In general, the assistance is meant to make sure the person is safe and is living to their best ability. At this point, the individuals are very susceptible to infections. When the symptoms and daily conditions get bad, usually, families turn to hospice care, so that the patient is comfortable at the end of their life.
        </p>
      <h2 id="cause">CAUSE</h2>
        <p>It is caused by misfolded proteins called plaques which are deposits of amyloid beta that forms between nerve cells that blocks the signals and stops the right materials from being sent to the nerve for survival. In a healthy brain, amyloid beta is used to help support neural repair and growth. However, in Alzheimer’s disease, there is an overproduction of this amyloid beta protein that disturbs these cells and eventually causes the death of the cells. The death of the old cells causes the loss of old memories and information. The blocking of nerve cells can stop the production of new connections, which means short term memories are not being accurately encoded in the brain to become long term memories.
        <br>Another major cause of AD is a component of neurofibrillary tangles called Tau. In a healthy brain, tau is used to help support neural strength and is important in keeping stability in the cells. However, in AD patients, Tau gets unstuck from the tube which leads to its disintegration, and a buildup leads to the cells not being able to receive signals and the supplies it needs to function (i.e., energy). These lead to death of the cells, leading to loss of information and life skills.
        <br>There is also a biomarker known as APOE-4, that is thought to predispose people to Alzheimer’s disease. This gene along with some environmental stressors could affect whether someone gets the disease and the progression of it. However, a lot of research is still being conducted on this topic and we are constantly rerouting what we know, as new information is found.
        <br>Nevertheless, AD remains one of the most mysterious conditions, with new discoveries and progress in scientific research pointing fingers to other probable reasons behind its causation.
        </p>
      <h2 id="cure">CURE</h2>
        <p>There’s not much an AD patient can do. There are no effective treatments. There’s no medicine. All we can do at the moment is help slow it down. Scientists recommend exercising, eating healthy and meditating, in addition to keeping your mind active by solving puzzles to help delay the start of AD. </p>
