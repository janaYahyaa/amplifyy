        <h2>Cure Alzheimer's Fund</h2>
        <p>A non-profit organization dedicated to funding research with the highest probability of preventing, slowing or reversing Alzheimer’s disease. The vision for Cure Alzheimer’s Fund was set by their founders. Frustrated with the slow pace of research about the disease, they applied their experience in venture capital and corporate startups to build an organization specifically designed to accelerate research, make bold bets, and eradicate the disease. The organization’s unwavering focus on finding a cure is also made possible by their Board of Directors and Trustees which finances their overhead expenses so that 100% of all donations go to support their research. </p>
